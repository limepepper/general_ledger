## django double entry general ledger library

> [!WARNING]  
> this is a work in progress. 

This library provides at the basic level a set of double entry accounting primitives. 

### Basic features

- `Book` - roughly corresponds to a company or organization. A book contains primitive objects such as accounts, transactions, and entries, and also higher level objects such as invoices and payments.

#### Primitives

- `Account` - a ledger account
- `Ledger` - a collection of transactions
- `Chart of Accounts` - a collection of accounts. One and only one per ledger. But a book can have multiple CoA instances.
- `Transaction` - a transaction between two or more ledger accounts, which must balance. Transactions must be associated to accounts in the same CoA.
- `TransactionEntry` - a single entry in a transaction, which is a credit or debit to an account.

#### Higher level features

- `Contact` - a contact or entity that can be associated with an invoice. Contacts can be customers, suppliers, or employees. 
- `Invoice` - a document that represents a request for payment from a customer. Invoices generate ledger transactions when they are posted.
- `Payment` - a payment made against an invoice. This generates the corresponding ledger transactions when posted. These can be automatically generated by matching bank payments to invoices.
